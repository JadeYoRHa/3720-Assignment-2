# 3720-Assignment-2

This was a project to improve the functionality of the website https://ultimateframedata.com/sf6/
It was notably missing a few key mechanics from the game that alter the numbers shown on the website itself so I added this functionality.

Click the sliders to alter the numbers shown on screen in coorelation with the status effect that can be acquired in game while playing.

Some characters have very unique attacks that are exceptions to the rules even in game so this code will not affect those particular moves.
