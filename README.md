# 3720-Assignment-2

This was a project to improve the functionality of the website https://ultimateframedata.com/sf6/
It was notably missing a few key mechanics from the game that alter the numbers shown on the website itself so I added this functionality.

Users can click the sliders to alter the numbers shown on screen in coorelation with the status effect that can be acquired in game while playing.

Counterhit is what happens when you hit the opponent before their attack has time to hit you which gives you a small advantage of +3, Punish Counter is when you let an opponent miss their attack and you hit them while their limb is extended out towards you giving a larger advantage of +4.

Drive Rush is a mechanic that boosts your character forwards and makes your next attack much stronger both on hit and when they block it at +4 for both on hit and on block.

Burnout is what occurs when the opponent has ran out of resources and has to take time to recover them again before they can attack effectively, this grants the attacker a bonus of +4 only on block.

Some characters have very unique attacks that are exceptions to the rules even in game so this code will not affect those particular moves.

I created this project strictly to improve my enjoyment while practicing street fighter 6 in whatever free time I can find, practicing certain combos and blockstrings can be very difficult when you don't know the correct numbers based on how they were modified in game and so now I can pull up this website and extension on the side and find the numbers without even having to test them in the game. This streamlines the practice process a lot and will help me manage my time in game to practice more efficiently.
